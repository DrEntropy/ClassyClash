# ClassyClash from Gamedev C++ Course

*  This is just a place to me to work through this as a review. 

*  The material here is pretty basic but repitition is the key to rentention! My approach in going through the course is to try and do it my way and then see how the instructor does it afterwards.  This is not very hard because the steps are pretty small. 

* One issue i had was trying to use std::vector instead of array of pointers (for the list of enemies).  This didn't work right with the textures, probably due to the shallow implicit copy.  I didn't persue it further. 

* Completed 11/2/2021  - fun stuff!
