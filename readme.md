*  This is just a place to me to work through this as a review. 

*  The material here is pretty basic but repitition is the key to rentention! My approach in going through the course is to try and do it my way and then see how the instructor does it afterwards.  This is not very hard because the steps are pretty small.  

* Completed 11/2/2021  - fun stuff!
